  "body": "## A little about me\r\n\r\nDuring my career, I have worked on about all areas of international macroeconomics and macro policy as well as formal political economy, finance and financial regulation, and labor markets and migration. My doctoral thesis, completed at LSE, was a study on the political economy of the implementation of financial regulations, particularly the 1988 Basel Accord.\r\n\r\nI have spent over 10 years as a World Bank and IMF economist and currently am senior economist in the World Bank's Prospects Group, which is responsible for forecasting, modeling and exploring future scenarios for economic growth and development, based in the research and data arm (DEC) of the Bank. I co-authored the 2015/2016 Global Monitoring Report that featured a chart listed by the New Yorker as one of the Four Charts that Defined the World in 2015 (http://goo.gl/0gRo9B). Previously, working for either the Bank or the Fund, I have covered Europe, Asia and the Middle East.\r\n\r\nAlso served as chief economist at two start-up financial services firms, mostly recently at a quant hedge fund (2014-15) where I worked on integrating US and global macro forecasts into reversion and momentum strategies to generate high and low frequency signals for a range of asset classes, particularly U.S. and global equities. I also worked on the engineering and backtesting of machine learning approaches to fundamentals-based investment strategies and continue to work on these in my spare time.\r\n\r\n## Some representative work\r\n\r\n*Global Monitoring Report 2015/2016: Development Goals in an Era of Demographic Change*, World Bank global flagship report, authored by a World Bank DEC team, October 2015.\r\n\r\nThe Caucasus and Central Asia: Transitioning to Emerging Markets, International Monetary Fund, Middle East and Central Asia Departmental Paper 14/2. I authored the bits on political economy and structural reforms and worked on monetary policy.\r\n\r\nRemittances, Institutions and Economic Growth, World Development, 37, 1. A widely cited paper on the impact of remittances on longer-term patterns of economic growth. Authored in 2009 with N. Catrinescu, M. Leon-Ledesma and M. Piracha.\r\n\r\nEast Asia Economic Update: Capturing New Sources of Growth, World Bank, May 2012. I was lead author of the Bank's flagship economic monitor for East Asia and the Pacific.\r\n\r\nSpotlight on European economic growth since 1945 in Golden Growth in Restoring the Luster of the European Economic Model, World Bank regional flagship report, April 2012. I authored a section in this widely cited study on the history of post-war economic growth, with a focus on productivity growth, in Europe as compared with the U.S. and other parts of the world.\r\n\r\nInternational Financial Co-operation: Political Economics of Compliance with the 1988 Basel Accord, Rutledge, February 2008. Based on my doctoral thesis, this is a global comparative analysis of the implementation of the first Basel agreement for banks' credit risks.\r\n",
