## A little about me

My research is at the intersection of economics, quantitative modeling of various sorts, and public policy. My publications span macroeconomics, economic development, international cooperation, demographics, migration, regulation, and most recently I have done work on the development of agent based approaches to model cancer progression. I completed my PhD at the London School of Economics and have taught at McGill, LSE, and Georgetown. My next book (Machine Learning and AI for Macroeconomics) will be published by CRC Press in 2021.

Presently, I am the head of global economics and modeling at Pfizer, where I manages a cross-functional team of economists and data scientists that provides economic analysis and modeling (including econometric, machine learning/AI, and agent-based modeling) for teams across the organization, including clinical practice areas, real world evidence, and commercial units such as pricing, finance, corporate strategy, and beyond. 

Previously, I spent over a decade as an economist at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund where I worked on economies across most regions of the world. In my last position, I spent time in the World Bank's research department (DECPG) on the Global Modeling and Anlytics division and the Global Macroeconomics division, which are responsible for forecasting, modeling and exploring future scenarios for economic growth and development. 

I also served as chief economist at a quant hedge fund where I integrated U.S. and global macro forecasts into reversion and momentum strategies to generate high and low frequency signals for a range of asset classes, particularly U.S. and global equities. I also managed a portfolio of long-only global equities.
