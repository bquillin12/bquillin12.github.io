<p>During my career, I have worked on about all areas of international macroeconomics and macro policy as well as formal political economy, finance and financial regulation, and labor markets and migration. My doctoral thesis, completed at LSE, was a study on the political economy of the implementation of financial regulations, particularly the 1988 Basel Accord.</p>

<p>I have spent over 10 years as a World Bank and IMF economist and currently am senior economist in the World Bank's Prospects Group, which is responsible for forecasting, modeling and exploring future scenarios for economic growth and development, based in the research and data arm (DEC) of the Bank. I co-authored the 2015/2016 Global Monitoring Report that featured a chart listed by the New Yorker as one of the Four Charts that Defined the World in 2015 (<a href="http://goo.gl/0gRo9B">http://goo.gl/0gRo9B</a>). Previously, working for either the Bank or the Fund, I have covered Europe, Asia and the Middle East.</p>

<p>Also served as chief economist at two start-up financial services firms, mostly recently at a quant hedge fund (2014-15) where I worked on integrating US and global macro forecasts into reversion and momentum strategies to generate high and low frequency signals for a range of asset classes, particularly U.S. and global equities. I also worked on the engineering and backtesting of machine learning approaches to fundamentals-based investment strategies and continue to work on these in my spare time.</p>
