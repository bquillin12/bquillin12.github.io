<p>* During my career, I have worked on about all areas of international macroeconomics and macro policy as well as formal political economy, finance and financial regulation, and labor markets and migration. I have worked in large, multilaterial organizations and small, start-up ventures. I have served on the advisory boards of a number of start ups in the areas of investment management, data analytics and visualization, and content management. I earned my PhD at LSE in 2004. </p>

<p>* I have spent over 10 years as a World Bank and IMF economist and currently am senior economist in the Global Modeling and Analytics team of the World Bank's Prospects Group, which is responsible for forecasting, modeling and exploring future scenarios for economic growth and development, based in the research and data arm (DEC). Previously, I held research and operational positions covering economies across Europe, Asia and the Middle East. </p> 

<p>* Also served as chief economist at two start-up financial services firms, mostly recently at a quant hedge fund (2014-15) where I worked on integrating U.S. and global macro forecasts into reversion and momentum strategies to generate high and low frequency signals for a range of asset classes, particularly equities and fixed income. I worked on the design, coding and backtesting of machine learning approaches to fundamentals-based investment strategies. </p>
